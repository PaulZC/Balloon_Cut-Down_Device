Designed to be interfaced to the [Iridium 9603N V5 Beacon](https://github.com/PaulZC/Iridium_9603_Beacon), but can be operated by: any push-to-close
switch; a normally-open relay contact; or a 3.3V logic signal.

The device comprises:
- [Scott Archery Shark release aid](https://scottarchery.com/collections/releases/products/shark-release), actuated by a
- [HiTec HS-82MG servo](https://www.servoshop.co.uk/index.php?pid=HITHS82MG&area=Servo), controlled by
- Arduino-compatible electronics based on the Adafruit Adalogger Feather M0, incorporating the Atmel SAMD21G18A processor, mounted on a
- bespoke carbon-fibre base plate with carbon-fibre linkage between the servo and the release aid

See [SERVO.md](https://github.com/PaulZC/Balloon_Cut-Down_Device/blob/master/Archive/V1/SERVO.md) for details on how to modify the HiTec servo for
high altitude operation.

See [SHARK.md](https://github.com/PaulZC/Balloon_Cut-Down_Device/blob/master/Archive/V1/SHARK.md) for details on how to incorporate the Scott Archery Shark release aid
into the Cut-Down Device.

See [ASSEMBLY.md](https://github.com/PaulZC/Balloon_Cut-Down_Device/blob/master/Archive/V1/ASSEMBLY.md) for details on how to assemble the PCB and the device itself.
