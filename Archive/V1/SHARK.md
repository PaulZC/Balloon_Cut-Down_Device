# Shark Release Aid Modification

The Balloon Cut-Down Device uses a [HiTec HS-82MG servo](https://www.servoshop.co.uk/index.php?pid=HITHS82MG&area=Servo) to operate the
[Scott Archery Shark release aid](https://scottarchery.com/collections/releases/products/shark-release). The Shark is a well designed piece
of kit, able to withstand high release loads and yet operate with the minimum of trigger pressure.

### Remove the Wrist Strap

Use a 3/32" hexagon key to remove the 4-40 screw which secures the Shark release to the swivel.

### Versions

The Shark release comes in two versions: one with a removeable trigger and one with a fixed, one-piece trigger. Choose the corresponding
trigger block to match whichever version you have: one replaces the removeable trigger; one slides over the fixed trigger.

### Apply Space Grease

It may be overkill, but I would recommend replacing the standard machine oil in the release with Castrol Braycote 601 EF grease. Braycote 601 EF is a
low temperature (-80C), low outgassing, non-flammable, non-toxic grease which is approved by NASA. It is expensive, but you are only going to need a
very small amount to modify each release.

Working from the side of the release that has the Scott logo (not the word "Shark"), use a 1.6mm parallel pin punch to tap out the pin holding the
jaw nearest the trigger in place.

The two jaws are pushed apart by a spring. Hold them together as you remove the pin, otherwise the spring will disappear into the darkest corner of
your workshop! There is also a ball bearing which makes the jaws move together. Be careful this doesn't also roll away into that same dark corner.

Wipe off the machine oil and then apply Braycote sparingly to all the moving parts.

Re-insert the pin and tap it back into place, working from the side of the release with the word "Shark" on it.

### Add the Trigger Block

[Cut-Down_Device.pdf](https://github.com/PaulZC/Balloon_Cut-Down_Device/blob/master/Archive/V1/Drawings/Cut-Down_Device.pdf) contains the drawings for the two
different versions of the trigger block.

- If your Shark has a green anodised removeable trigger, unscrew it and install the first version of the trigger block using a 3/4" 4-40 UNC screw.
- If your Shark has a black fixed trigger, slide the second version of the trigger block over the trigger using a small amount of epoxy to secure it in place.


Modifying the Shark will of course void your warranty.
